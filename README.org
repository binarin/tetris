* What happens when player arrives on a game page
  - ws/bullet connection is initiated
  - bullet init/4 callback is called
  - we should start unique process that will handle interaction with this player
    - this process will also handle queueing of outgoing network
      commands (for a very short time, in case bullet connection is
      lost)
    - this process can be in one of the following states:
      - waiting for opponent
      - playing
      - lost
      - won
  - after opponnent has connected, we should enter 'playing' state,
    and create new tetris_game process.
